# weather_dashboard

A small Flutter app that:
1. Reads your student index (e.g., 194174B)
2. Derives latitude/longitude from it
3. Calls Open-Meteo (no API key) and shows the current weather
4. Displays index, coords, request URL, last update time, and handles errors
5. Caches the last successful result locally (so it shows something offline)
